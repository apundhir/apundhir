# Ajay Pundhir

**Global AI Strategist | Head of AI at Presight (G42) | Founder, AiExponent**

Global AI strategist and enterprise leader at the forefront of the autonomous era. I orchestrate the delivery of large-scale, industrial-grade AI platforms at Presight (G42), transforming breakthrough research into sovereign-scale solutions — with a dual commitment to technical precision and institutional integrity, particularly in the operationalization of Responsible and Agentic AI.


As Founder of AiExponent, I translate nearly two decades of leadership into high-stakes strategic counsel — Board and Executive Advisory on AI governance, confidential Leadership Coaching for C-suite executives, and founder mentorship through Stanford SEED and LISA programs.


**Credentials:** IEEE Senior Member · HBS Advisory Council · MIT Technology Review Committee · Forbes Technology Council · Senior Executive AI Think Tank · Stanford SEED & LISA Mentor · IAPP AIGP Certified

🔭 **Currently exploring:** Agentic AI guardrails & safety · AI risk classification across regulatory contexts · 'Cognitive capital' as a measurable organizational asset
